Bruce Schneier[http://http://www.schneier.com], a widely-recognized security expert, is attributed with formulating Scheier's Law (which he himself attributes to Babbage in [what year]).

As stated by Doctorow[http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt]

[blockquote]
[A]ny person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it.
[/blockquote]

Schneier later clarifies[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html] that it is not that each person believes they can construct an unbreakable system, but that, when failing to break it, will conclude that it is unbreakable.

May I offer an economic corollary:
[blockquote]
Any person can invent an economic "predicament" so clever that he or she can't think of how to solve it without government intervention.
they themselves cannot conceive of a solution that doesn't require government intervention.
[\blockquote]

I believe I could adequately capture their concern in the question
How could people acting only in their own interest solve that problem?

I think it is wise to recognize that a person's own interest does not necessarily mean interest in themselves. In fact, the interests of most people are much broader than their own needs. (For example, look at the case of gay marriage. The vast majority of people would not directly benefit from gay marriage in that they would not participate in one, but support it in their particular interest in their family members, friends, neighbors, and humanity in general. Be careful with this.)

To the above, they implicitly believe that people should be able to act in their interest without infringing on that part of others, but they shouldn't believe that everyone should act in /that particular interest/ because it cannot be universally applied. Suppose the majority wanted something opposed to them. The majority (by definition of the discrimination of M and m) always is opposed to the minority. Some think that that is enough to remove their rights, but rights are not in actuality (and should not be in practice) determined by the majority vote.

It seems that people think that to believe that capitalism is Darwinism and its proponents are selfish and have malice. On the right, people think thet lefties are selfish and full of malice. It seems that both have compassion in general. The right side believes that the principle of liberty is most important--it allows people to act in their interest.
