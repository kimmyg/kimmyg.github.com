The Amish didn't want to participate in Social Security for religious reasons but were forced to. Their freedom of conscience was taken away.

Consider their history.

They homesteaded the land they now live in, presumably were there before US jurisdiction. The United States government may have immorally claimed their land--taken it by force--and the subjected them to their own ideas of what was right--against their consciences. Make no mistake: this was by force. Some of their assets were auctioned off to pay the "debt".
