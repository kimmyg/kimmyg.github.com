<hr/>
<p>I am a research associate at the <a href="http://utah.edu/">University of Utah</a> <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/">School of Computing</a>. In the fall, I will begin a Ph.D. in Computer Science advised by <a href="http://matt.might.net">Matt Might</a>.</p>
<p>In December 2012, I received an M.S. in Computer Science from <a href="http://byu.edu">Brigham Young University</a>. For my thesis, I constructed a semantics-preserving transformation for continuation marks. My advisor was <a href="http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/">Jay McCarthy</a>.</p>
<p>Before working with Jay McCarthy, I studied and Internet Security. I was one of four members of BYU's winning team in the <a href="http://www.mitrestemctf.org/home/ctf">2011 MITRE STEM CTF</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I studied Statistics and Mathematics, and received a B.S. in Mathematics with a specialized minor in Computer Science, also from BYU.</p>
