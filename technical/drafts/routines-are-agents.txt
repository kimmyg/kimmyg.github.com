Routines are Agents (and Actors)

I see a lot of similarities between computation using routines and family relationships.

A brother who fears his older brother is like a subroutine: He'll probably do what his other brother says, but if things get out of hand, he goes to his parents and raises a concern (exception). If the siblings have any kind of agreement set up, the parent will determine blame.

Spouses are like coroutines. Neither one can control the other, and each runs the risk of leaving the other suspended, but if they work together, they can get a lot done.

These analogies are bad because they don't offer any insight unless the different types of routines are well-understood and, even then, the amount of insight they offer is small.
